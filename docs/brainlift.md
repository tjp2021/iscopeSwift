# RootCauseAnalysis

## Consolidated Findings

### Error Pattern Analysis
- Firebase Auth: Successfully creating accounts (✓)
- Firestore Write: Failing with WebChannelConnection errors (✗)
- Error Type: Transport errors on Write stream
- Multiple Retry Attempts: System tried 6+ times (0x3e090c35 through 0x3e090c3b)
- Timing: Errors occur immediately after auth success

### Deep Code Investigation

1. Connection Setup:
   - Using Web SDK in React Native environment
   - ForceLongPolling enabled but still getting WebChannel errors
   - Write operations failing despite successful auth

2. Error Characteristics:
   - All errors are WebChannelConnection RPC 'Write' stream failures
   - Transport errors occurring during write attempts
   - Consistent pattern of failure across multiple retry attempts
   - Each attempt generates new session IDs but same error

3. Infrastructure Analysis:
   - Running in Expo environment
   - Bridgeless mode is enabled (NOBRIDGE logs)
   - Using Hermes JS engine
   - Network requests failing at transport layer

## Novel Analysis Report

Potential Root Cause(s): 
- React Native's networking layer is incompatible with Firestore Web SDK's WebChannel implementation
- The current configuration is trying to use WebSockets when it should be using HTTP long-polling
- The experimentalForceLongPolling setting isn't being properly applied

Evidence:
- Successful auth (REST-based) vs failed Firestore (WebChannel-based)
- Multiple transport errors specifically on Write operations
- Consistent failure pattern across retry attempts

Why previous fixes didn't solve it:
- Setting experimentalForceLongPolling alone isn't sufficient
- The WebChannel is still trying to establish despite our settings
- Network transport layer is fundamentally incompatible

Recommended Fundamental Changes:
1. Switch to @react-native-firebase/firestore SDK
2. OR implement complete set of React Native specific settings:
   ```typescript
   const settings = {
     experimentalForceLongPolling: true,
     experimentalAutoDetectLongPolling: false,
     merge: true
   };
   ```
3. OR downgrade to a known working version of Firestore SDK

## Action Plan

1. Immediate Steps:
   - Remove conflicting Firestore settings
   - Add complete error handling in SignUpScreen
   - Implement retry mechanism with backoff
   - Add detailed logging for debugging

2. Risk Mitigation:
   - Backup plan: Switch to @react-native-firebase/firestore if Web SDK continues to fail
   - Document all attempted solutions
   - Monitor error rates after changes
   - Test on both iOS and Android

   transaction.setData(commentData, forDocument: commentRef)
   
   // Local state
   updatedVideo.likeCount = currentLikeCount + 1
   self.comments.insert(newComment, at: 0)
   ```

2. Error Handling:
   ```swift
   // Auth checks
   guard let currentUser = Auth.auth().currentUser else {
       self.error = "You must be signed in"
       return video
   }
   
   // Error propagation
   catch {
       print("❌ Error: \(error)")
       self.error = error.localizedDescription
   }
   ```

3. Verification:

# RootCauseAnalysis

## Consolidated Findings

### Error Pattern Analysis
- Firebase Auth: Successfully creating accounts (✓)
- Firestore Write: Failing with WebChannelConnection errors (✗)
- Error Type: Transport errors on Write stream
- Multiple Retry Attempts: System tried 6+ times (0x3e090c35 through 0x3e090c3b)
- Timing: Errors occur immediately after auth success

### Deep Code Investigation

1. Connection Setup:
   - Using Web SDK in React Native environment
   - ForceLongPolling enabled but still getting WebChannel errors
   - Write operations failing despite successful auth

2. Error Characteristics:
   - All errors are WebChannelConnection RPC 'Write' stream failures
   - Transport errors occurring during write attempts
   - Consistent pattern of failure across multiple retry attempts
   - Each attempt generates new session IDs but same error

3. Infrastructure Analysis:
   - Running in Expo environment
   - Bridgeless mode is enabled (NOBRIDGE logs)
   - Using Hermes JS engine
   - Network requests failing at transport layer

## Novel Analysis Report

Potential Root Cause(s): 
- React Native's networking layer is incompatible with Firestore Web SDK's WebChannel implementation
- The current configuration is trying to use WebSockets when it should be using HTTP long-polling
- The experimentalForceLongPolling setting isn't being properly applied

Evidence:
- Successful auth (REST-based) vs failed Firestore (WebChannel-based)
- Multiple transport errors specifically on Write operations
- Consistent failure pattern across retry attempts

Why previous fixes didn't solve it:
- Setting experimentalForceLongPolling alone isn't sufficient
- The WebChannel is still trying to establish despite our settings
- Network transport layer is fundamentally incompatible

Recommended Fundamental Changes:
1. Switch to @react-native-firebase/firestore SDK
2. OR implement complete set of React Native specific settings:
   ```typescript
   const settings = {
     experimentalForceLongPolling: true,
     experimentalAutoDetectLongPolling: false,
     merge: true
   };
   ```
3. OR downgrade to a known working version of Firestore SDK

## Action Plan

1. Immediate Steps:
   - Remove conflicting Firestore settings
   - Add complete error handling in SignUpScreen
   - Implement retry mechanism with backoff
   - Add detailed logging for debugging

2. Risk Mitigation:
   - Backup plan: Switch to @react-native-firebase/firestore if Web SDK continues to fail
   - Document all attempted solutions
   - Monitor error rates after changes
   - Test on both iOS and Android

- Regular state verification

**Best Practices**
- Use proper type conversion for Firestore
- Implement loading states
- Cache translations
- Clear error handling
- Maintain state consistency

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid**
- Direct timestamp serialization
- Mixing UI and business logic
- Ignoring loading states
- Skipping error handling
- Redundant translation requests 

# Caption_Styling_Implementation_Analysis

## Problem/Feature Overview

Initial Requirements:
- Font size control for captions
- Settings persistence
- Real-time updates
- Clean UI integration

Key Challenges:
- State sharing between components
- Parameter order in initializers
- Build performance issues
- Component hierarchy

Success Criteria:
- Working font size control
- Persistent settings
- Real-time preview matches actual captions
- Clean UI integration

## Solution Attempts

### Attempt #1: Initial CC Button Integration
- Approach: Added CC button to side menu
- Implementation: Basic button with icon
- Outcome: UI cluttered, poor visibility
- Learnings: Need better button placement

### Attempt #2: Bottom Controls Integration
- Approach: Moved CC button to bottom controls
- Implementation: Added styled button with text
- Outcome: Successful, better visibility
- Learnings: Bottom placement works better for accessibility

### Attempt #3: State Management
- Approach: Component-level state management
- Implementation: Individual ViewModels
- Outcome: State sync issues
- Learnings: Need shared state management

### Final Solution
Implementation Details:
- Shared CaptionSettingsViewModel
- UserDefaults persistence
- Real-time state updates
- Clean component hierarchy

Why It Works:
- Single source of truth for settings
- Simple persistence mechanism
- Clear state propagation
- Intuitive UI placement

Key Components:
- CaptionSettingsView
- CaptionSettingsViewModel
- VideoPageView integration
- Persistent storage

## Key Lessons

Technical Insights:
- Keep state management simple
- Test parameter orders early
- Monitor build performance
- Use proper component hierarchy

Process Improvements:
- Incremental feature development
- Regular build performance checks
- Clear component documentation
- Systematic testing approach

Best Practices:
- KISS principle adherence
- Single file focus
- Clear state ownership
- Build performance monitoring

Anti-Patterns to Avoid:
- Complex state management
- Cluttered UI placement
- Parameter order confusion
- Build performance neglect

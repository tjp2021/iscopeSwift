# Auth_Setup_Analysis

## Problem/Feature Overview

Initial Requirements:
- Set up Firebase Auth with proper persistence
- Implement sign in/sign up screens
- Follow MVP setup guide strictly

Key Challenges:
- Firebase persistence warning in React Native
- Navigation setup issues
- Multiple Firebase SDK approaches conflicting

Success Criteria:
- Working auth flow
- Proper error handling
- Persistence between sessions

## Solution Attempts

### Attempt #1: React Native Firebase SDK
- Approach: Switched to @react-native-firebase/auth
- Implementation: Changed imports and initialization
- Outcome: Failed - Deviated from MVP guide
- Learnings: Stick to specified tech stack in MVP guide

### Attempt #2: AsyncStorage with Web SDK
- Approach: Added getReactNativePersistence
- Implementation: Modified firebase config
- Outcome: Failed - Import resolution issues
- Learnings: Firebase web SDK needs different persistence approach

### Attempt #3: Back to Basics
- Approach: Reverted to original MVP setup
- Implementation: Basic Firebase web SDK
- Outcome: Working but with persistence warning
- Learnings: MVP functionality over premature optimization

## Final Solution
Implementation Details:
- Using Firebase Web SDK (as per MVP guide)
- Added proper error logging
- Improved input handling
- Basic but functional auth flow

Why It Works:
- Follows MVP guide exactly
- Prioritizes functionality over optimization
- Clear error handling for debugging

## Key Lessons

Technical Insights:
- Don't mix different SDK approaches
- Add logging before optimization
- Follow platform conventions

Process Improvements:
- Check MVP guide first
- Test with proper debugging tools
- Add error handling early

Best Practices:
- Proper keyboard configuration
- Detailed error messages
- Console logging for debugging

Anti-Patterns to Avoid:
- Premature optimization
- Mixing different SDKs
- Over-engineering persistence

# RootCauseAnalysis

## Consolidated Findings

### Error Pattern Analysis
- Firebase Auth: Successfully creating accounts (✓)
- Firestore Write: Failing with WebChannelConnection errors (✗)
- Error Type: Transport errors on Write stream
- Multiple Retry Attempts: System tried 6+ times (0x3e090c35 through 0x3e090c3b)
- Timing: Errors occur immediately after auth success

### Deep Code Investigation

1. Connection Setup:
   - Using Web SDK in React Native environment
   - ForceLongPolling enabled but still getting WebChannel errors
   - Write operations failing despite successful auth

2. Error Characteristics:
   - All errors are WebChannelConnection RPC 'Write' stream failures
   - Transport errors occurring during write attempts
   - Consistent pattern of failure across multiple retry attempts
   - Each attempt generates new session IDs but same error

3. Infrastructure Analysis:
   - Running in Expo environment
   - Bridgeless mode is enabled (NOBRIDGE logs)
   - Using Hermes JS engine
   - Network requests failing at transport layer

## Novel Analysis Report

Potential Root Cause(s): 
- React Native's networking layer is incompatible with Firestore Web SDK's WebChannel implementation
- The current configuration is trying to use WebSockets when it should be using HTTP long-polling
- The experimentalForceLongPolling setting isn't being properly applied

Evidence:
- Successful auth (REST-based) vs failed Firestore (WebChannel-based)
- Multiple transport errors specifically on Write operations
- Consistent failure pattern across retry attempts

Why previous fixes didn't solve it:
- Setting experimentalForceLongPolling alone isn't sufficient
- The WebChannel is still trying to establish despite our settings
- Network transport layer is fundamentally incompatible

Recommended Fundamental Changes:
1. Switch to @react-native-firebase/firestore SDK
2. OR implement complete set of React Native specific settings:
   ```typescript
   const settings = {
     experimentalForceLongPolling: true,
     experimentalAutoDetectLongPolling: false,
     merge: true
   };
   ```
3. OR downgrade to a known working version of Firestore SDK

## Action Plan

1. Immediate Steps:
   - Remove conflicting Firestore settings
   - Add complete error handling in SignUpScreen
   - Implement retry mechanism with backoff
   - Add detailed logging for debugging

2. Risk Mitigation:
   - Backup plan: Switch to @react-native-firebase/firestore if Web SDK continues to fail
   - Document all attempted solutions
   - Monitor error rates after changes
   - Test on both iOS and Android
